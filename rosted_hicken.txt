Ingredients

1 whole chicken (about 4 pounds)
Salt and pepper, to taste
4 tablespoons butter, softened
2 teaspoons dried rosemary
2 teaspoons dried thyme
2 teaspoons dried sage
1 teaspoons ginger
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 lemon, halved
4 sprigs fresh rosemary
4 sprigs fresh thyme
4 sprigs fresh sage
1 onion, cut into wedges
4 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
4 potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
2 tablespoons olive oil

Instructions

Preheat oven to 375°F and lightly grease a baking dish or a roasting pan.
Rinse the chicken and pat it dry with paper towels. Season the cavity with salt and pepper.
In a small bowl, stir together butter, dried rosemary, dried thyme, dried sage and garlic. Rub the butter mixture all over the chicken skin and under the skin of the breast.
Squeeze the juice of one lemon half over the chicken and place the lemon half inside the cavity. Add the fresh rosemary, thyme and sage sprigs to the cavity as well.
Tie the legs together with kitchen twine and tuck the wings under the body of the chicken.
Place the onion, carrots and potatoes in a large bowl and toss with olive oil, salt and pepper. Arrange them around the chicken in the baking dish or roasting pan.
Roast for 1 hour and 30 minutes or until the chicken is golden and cooked through. The internal temperature of the thickest part of the thigh should read 165°F.
Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for 10 minutes before carving. Serve with the roasted vegetables and the juice from the pan.

Enjoy! 😋
